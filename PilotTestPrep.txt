Why does altitude move in the same direction as barometric pressure when adjusting the altimeter?

The way I always think about it is with the airplane sitting on the ground.
Imagine an airplane at an airport at 500 ft. ASL. The atmospheric pressure outside is standard 29.92", 
so the indicated altitude is 500 ft. ASL. Now imagine a lower pressure system moving in over night, 
and the next day, you go back and look at the altimeter. Say the new atmospheric pressure is now 28.92". 
Under standard conditions at this aerodrome, 28.92" of pressure is encountered at 1,500 ft. ASL, or 1,000 ft. AGL. 
So, the altimeter interprets this new low pressure system as a climb up 1,000 ft. The altimeter is now 
indicating 1,500 ft.

So, the current altimeter setting is 1" too high (pressure went from 29.92" yesterday to 28.92" now). 
The altimeter is also reading too high, at 1,500 ft. indicated. The way to correct for this is to 
lower your altimeter setting, which is to set it at 28.92". This brings your altimeter's reading back 
down to 500 ft. AGL.
