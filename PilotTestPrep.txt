QUESTIONS
=========
Advisory Circulars, where do I find them? How do I know about them?
Airmets vs Sigmets? 
Airworthness Directives, where do I find them? How do I know about them?
What Constitues 'Anti-Collision' Lights? Beacon? Strobes?
Why are weather minimums less for a class B?
Still need radio & Transponder if in class E and under B/C shelves?
